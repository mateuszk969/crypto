  "body": "Arrinera, the producer of the Polish racing car Hussarya, announced that he is planning a cryptocurrency issue of shares, and more precisely their counterparts, i.e. tokens.\r\n\n\\- MBO (managerial buyout) is being considered potentially with the exit of Arrinera from NewConnect - said ISBnews Arkadiusz Kuich, co-founder of Arrinery at Cryptocurrency World Expo.\r\n\nManagers have development plans - they anticipate the creation of an electric supercar that would be allowed for traffic. Where does the money will come from? Representatives explain this in quite knotty way, notes money.pl.\r\n\n\\- For this purpose, we are planning an initial coin offering (ICO) or security token offering (STO) through the already launched Arrinera.io project. Currently, we present our ICO in Europe and Asia and analyze legislation regarding the company's tokenization process. We estimate Softcap for the issue of our own cryptocurrency at 10 million dollars - added Piotr Gniadek, co-founder of Arrinera.",

Arrinera even got One and a half years ago, the advance payment for one car, but the transaction is stopped by the lack of approval \", notes the portal. The website brutally concludes that \"three copies were made for the money collected.\" The company exists only because it has managed to sell the shares a few times \"."
