The company has published a statement in which it announces that after the commencement of trading in cryptocurrencies through the Bison application, the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) platform will soon be created.\r\n\n\rCryptocurrencies have become the main development goal of the company because it intends to continue the digitization strategy in order to eventually become a pioneer of the digital transformation of financial markets and financial products.\r\n\n\\- In the trading system of tokens, through our ICO platform, you can trade on the secondary market. This is an important factor for success for ICO.
