  "body": "With the lowest amount required to become an Antiguan Barbudian via an investment being US$100,000, you now only need a little over 12 bitcoins to pay for that at current prices. This is after Antigua and Barbuda’s Citizenship by Investment Program Act was amended by the country’s parliament allowing payments to be made using bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies. The resolution was announced by the country’s Prime Minister and Minister of Finance & Corporate Governance & Public-Private Partnerships, Hon. Gaston Browne, according to Antigua News Room.\r \n\nTo be eligible for citizenship via Antigua and Barbuda’s Citizenship by Investment Program Act, individuals can choose to either invest in the country amounts ranging between US$400,000 and US$1.5 million or make a contribution totalling US$100,000 to the country’s National Development Fund. Additional amounts are also required to be paid based on the number of dependents one has.",

Last year in April, for instance, the country’s attorney general was instructed by the cabinet to draft legislation that would allow government services to be paid for using bitcoin."
