The latest IDC report shows that Europe is the second largest market for this technology, with the United States leading the way. There, they indicate, investors pump the largest capital into it. According to IDC, financial, production and service industries are the most likely to reach blockchain.\r\n\n\"This year, the blockchain investments in the Old Continent will reach 400 million dollars,\" predicts the IDC consulting company. \"It's quite a lot for relatively young technology, but not much compared to the 2022 investment pool. For 4 years, spending on blockchain-based solutions will reach $ 3.5 billion in Europe, which means that the market is growing at a dizzying speed 80.2%. \", indicates Interaktywnie.pl.",
  "gallery": "The portal draws attention to the fact that analysts from IDC have identified six sectors in which they expect the greatest penetration of blockchain-based solutions. In their opinion, the dispersed chain of blocks will be the most popular in the area of â€‹finance - as much as 43% spending on this technology will come from this sector, indicates the portal. \"In the second place, with 20% share, there was an industrial production sector: 11% of blockchain investment comes from the service industry, 8% from the infrastructure market and the same from the public sector.\""
