  "body": "During a six-monthly testimony to Congress, Jerome Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve System (FED), described cryptocurrencies as \"a great tool for hiding or laundering money.\" During testimony to the Financial Services Committee of the Chamber of Commerce, he also stressed that cryptocurrencies are not strong enough to threaten the current financial system. The head of the Federal Reserve maintains its negative position to cryptocurrencies and claims that investors in cryptocurrencies are na√Øve.",
  "gallery": "There is no doubt that Powell, like his predecessor, are of the opinion that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were built solely on price speculation. The cryptocurrency market, estimated at over 200 billion, is not big enough to threaten the current financial system, and the US central bank does not want to regulate it, said Powell. The Federal Reserve has no jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies, nor does it seek to provide supervision in the crypto sector. Federal agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, have started to supervise many companies related to cryptocurrencies."
