Trading tokens will be traded on it, similar to the shares of a given company, according to BusinessInsider.",
  "gallery": "\\- We are thrilled to announce the partnerships with Malta Stock Exchange and Binance, that will ensure high liquidity to equity tokens issued on Neufund. It is the first time in history, that security tokens can be offered and traded in a legally binding way. The upcoming pilot project will allow us to test the marketâ€™s reaction and realize the overall project idea in an environment with minimized risk - says Adamovicz. The Maltese Minister of Finance Edward Scicluna described this day as a \"historic moment\" and added that Malta is becoming a global leader in the blockchain sector."
