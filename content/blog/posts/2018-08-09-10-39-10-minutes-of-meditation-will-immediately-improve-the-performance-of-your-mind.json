We have now learned that you do not have to meditate for weeks to see improvement - says the author of the research, Dr. Hedy Kober from Yale University.\r\n\nResearchers recruited 40 students to study (including 14 women) aged 17 to 22 years. Participants were divided into two groups - the first for ten minutes was listening to a meditative recording, and the second to a recording with a text about sequoia. Subsequently, both groups underwent a series of simple cognitive tests.\r\n\nPeople who listened to the meditation record during the tests performed clearly better (solved the tasks faster and more precisely) than the second group. The exception was people with a high level of neuroticism.\r\n\nMindfullness meditation (focusing on a given moment) can improve work memory and concentration. These results indicate that even people who have never meditated can benefit from short awareness training - comments the authors.",
