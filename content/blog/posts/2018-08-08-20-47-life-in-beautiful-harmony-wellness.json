  "body": "Wellness - a lot is hidden behind this one word. The concept was noticed in the 1950s by Halbert L. Dunn, although its origins appeared in the nineteenth century. The term itself is used in relation to the process - lifestyle and way of being - which gives fine balance of the mind, body and spirit. In our opinion, it is the right combination of rituals, places in which we spend time and all those little things that make life better.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe WELLNESS department will be your inexhaustible source of ideas and concepts whose goal is one: improving well-being. We will tell you what food will please your eyes and body, where you will be delighted by the sunset and which coast offers the widest selection of attractions and breathtaking views. Objects, diets and exercises presented by us are not intended to promote their authors and / or producers - it is a subjective choice of what we think is the best among the best. Aim: to help you embellish yourself and your life.",
