  "body": "The Coinbase exchange has become the first cryptocurrency organization in the USA to set up its Political Action Committee (PAC). It results from a document that is available on the website of the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nUnder US federal law, the Committee must meet several conditions to be registered - including obliged to collect from its members donations with a total value of over USD 1,000 and transfer them to the campaign fund. Such organizations must register with FEC in accordance with the provisions of the 1974 Election Campaign Act.\r\n\nThe US Cryptocut exchange Coinbase has hired a team of former Wall Street executives to attract institutional investors to the digital currency market. According to BusinessInsider, Coinbase already has a $ 20 billion hedge fund for Coinbase Prime brokerage services and has donated more than $ 81,000 for political purposes.",

By this the group from under the sign of Coinbase clearly affirms that he wants to participate actively and actively in shaping the American law on cryptocurrencies."
