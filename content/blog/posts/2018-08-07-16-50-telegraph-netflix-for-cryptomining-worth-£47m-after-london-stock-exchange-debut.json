I am talking about Argo Blockchain, a company that extracts cryptocurrencies, which at IPO (Initial Public Offering) raised a £ 25 million worth, finishing with worth £ 47 million.\r \n\nArgo allows customers to dig Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Bitcoin Gold and ZCash - all without using their own computer equipment. This works in a similar way to Netflix or Amazon. Users pay monthly subscriptions and receive cryptocurrencies - in direct proportion to the amount of money paid.\r\n\nBithub.pl journalists indicate that \"Argo Blockchain was founded in December 2017, and the company launched operations only in June 2018, two weeks after receiving approval from the British Financial Supervision Authority (FCA)\", exercising regulatory oversight of 58,000 companies providing financial services and financial markets in the United Kingdom.",
