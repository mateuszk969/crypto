  "body": "Citing multiple anonymous sources familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reports that Goldman Sachs, the second-largest investment bank, is holding discussions about becoming one of the first mainstream financial institutions to custody cryptocurrency assets. Bank is mulling launching a custodial service to store bitcoin for investment funds that want to hold cryptocurrency.\r\n\n\"This service would be a major boon for cryptocurrency funds, but it could also have far greater implications since it would remove a major obstacle preventing institutional investors such as pensions and endowments from feeling comfortable adding cryptoassets to their portfolios\", CCN noticed. Such custody services exist, but they have heretofore largely been offered by cryptocurrency startups such as Coinbase - not the Wall Street giants with whom institutions prefer to work.\r\r\n\nHowever, Goldman has yet to publicly confirm that it is exploring a cryptocurrency custodial service, CCN informs. \r\n\n\"In response to client interest in various digital products we are exploring how best to serve them in this space,\" a spokesperson for Goldman Sachs said. \"At this point we have not reached a conclusion on the scope of our digital asset offering\".  \"Notably, thatâ€™s the same line that Goldman spokespeople gave in response to earlier reports that the firm was launching a bitcoin trading desk\", CCN noticed.",
  "gallery": "The report comes just one business day after Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) - the owner and operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) - revealed that it is launching a new subsidiary, called Bakkt, to develop cryptocurrency products and services and help bitcoin mature as a financial instrument."
