  "body": "\"Iran is moving ahead with a plan to introduce a national cryptocurrency, partly as a way of busting U.S. sanctions\", wrote \"Fortune\". The Iranian government said in April that it had developed an experimental domestic cryptocurrency. With the U.S. having since pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and restored more sanctions - a ban on buying U.S. dollars comes into force next month, and crude oil sanctions will follow in November - there’s a newfound urgency in the air.\r \n\nIran’s state-sponsored Press TV reported Wednesday that the \"plan to create an indigenous cryptocurrency\" was moving forward, and the central bank was working with \"domestic knowledge-based companies\" to develop the digital currency.\r \n\nFortune notice, that \"the Iranian central bank had long been cool on cryptocurrencies, to say at least\". Last year, reports suggested Iran was looking at Bitcoin as a solution for the country being cut off from international payments networks, but in February the central bank nixed the idea, expressing distaste for cryptocurrencies in general. The central bank then cracked down on financial institutions offering cryptocurrency services, in order to combat capital flight.\r\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Iran’s government fired the governor of the central bank for the last five years, Valiollah Seif, in part for not doing more to prepare for the U.S.’s reimposition of sanctions.",

Besides, it can help us at the time of sanctions\"."
