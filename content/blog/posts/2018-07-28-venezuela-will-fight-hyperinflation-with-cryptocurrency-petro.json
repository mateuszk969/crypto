  "body": "Venezuela is tackling hyperinflation by lopping five zeroes from the value of the bolivar, creating a new currency, the Sovereign Bolivar, that will be anchored to its cryptocurrency, the Petro. President Nicolas Maduro announced the implementation date yesterday as August 20, saying the country needs an \"economic revolution\".\r \n\nAnd it sorely does. As Fortune explains: Venezuela has been suffering under hyperinflation since Maduro took office in 2013, which coincided with falling oil prices and large macroeconomic imbalances that led to economic crisis. From his point of view, the country is the victim of an \"economic war\" waged by the U.S. Maduro was re-elected for another six years in May in an election the United Nations and the European Union called fraudulent.",
  "gallery": "The International Monetary Fund said the rate of inflation of the bolivar is set to hit 1,000,000% this year as Venezuela’s gross domestic product is expected to fall by 18%. \"The situation in Venezuela is similar to that in Germany in 1923 or Zimbabwe in the late 2000’s\", the IMF wrote in its report."
